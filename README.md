Turn a [build123d](https://github.com/gumyr/build123d) Python model into
measured CAD and verifiable export artifacts through MCP. Agent-facing
operations execute a parametric model, report OCCT geometry metrics, and export
STEP, STL, or GLB. Every export is promoted into a server-owned, immutable MCP
resource addressed by its SHA-256; agents receive the resource URI, MIME type,
size, and digest—not a host path.

![build123d_export result in the MCP App viewer](docs/assets/build123d-export-viewer.png)

The viewer renders a real `build123d_export` result from
`docs/fixtures/bracket-r1.py`, run in the published provider image. The model
and its status stay visible; geometry details and provenance open on demand. It
follows the host's light or dark theme and uses English or French labels.
`deno task capture:docs` regenerates the image from the committed fixture and
bundle.

At a glance:

- Parametric solids, sketches, extrusions, revolves, sweeps, lofts, booleans,
  holes, fillets, chamfers, patterns, and compounds can use the normal build123d
  API installed with the selected Python interpreter.
- STEP preserves the BREP, while STL and GLB are tessellated delivery formats.
- Every export returns an immutable resource URI with exact MIME type, byte
  count, and SHA-256 digest. `resources/read` rehashes the issued in-memory
  bytes before returning them.
- Mass is reported only from an explicit uniform density. No material or density
  is guessed.
- `build123d_observe_assembly_integrity` accepts one bounded, digest-bound STEP
  artifact, either inline or as a current-process owned `stepResource`; it never
  executes caller code and returns factual import, unit, topology, occurrence,
  placement and pair observations.
- `build123d_project_2d` accepts the same two STEP delivery forms and returns
  fixed orthographic, isometric and optional section SVGs for visual inspection.

## Why CAD-as-code for agents

An agent doesn't click — it writes. With a GUI CAD's API, building geometry
means one HTTP call per feature against a stateful document. With build123d,
**the script is the artifact**: generated in one shot, versionable, diffable,
replayable with a pinned build123d package and a configured execution
environment, and carrying its own traceability (the SysML element or requirement
that motivated a dimension can live in the code, as a comment or a variable
name).

The metrics are not estimates. Volume, surface area, center of mass and bounding
box come analytically from the BREP kernel rather than from the STL or GLB
tessellation.

## Quick start

### Already have build123d installed

No Docker image or source checkout is needed if you have Deno 2.9.6 and a Python
3.10+ interpreter with `build123d==0.11.1` and `OCP.__version__ == "7.9.3.1"`
(`cadquery-ocp-novtk==7.9.3.1.1`). Check the interpreter that the MCP server
will use:

```bash
python3 -I -c 'import sys, build123d, OCP; print(sys.executable, build123d.__version__, OCP.__version__)'
```

Put the printed Python path in your MCP client's stdio entry. Deno downloads the
published JSR package on first run:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "build123d": {
      "command": "deno",
      "args": ["run", "-A", "jsr:@casys/mcp-build123d@0.7.1/server", "--stdio"],
      "env": {
        "BUILD123D_PYTHON_BIN": "/absolute/path/to/qualified/python",
        "BUILD123D_EXPORT_DIR": "/absolute/path/to/private/cad-exports"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

During the first 24 hours after a package version is published, Deno may reject
it under its minimum dependency age rule. If that happens, add
`"--minimum-dependency-age=0"` immediately after `"run"` in `args` until the
version is old enough, then remove it. The same option works in the HTTP command
below. It temporarily disables Deno's age check for that invocation; keep the
exact package version pin.

The server checks those versions at startup and refuses a different pair. The
Python probe uses `-I`, so packages available only through `PYTHONPATH` or the
user site are not sufficient. If your client cannot find `deno`, set `command`
to its absolute path.

### Run a source checkout

Requirements are Deno 2.9.6 and Python 3.10+. The provider qualifies the exact
`build123d==0.11.1` / `cadquery-ocp-novtk==7.9.3.1.1` pair (reported by Python
as `OCP.__version__ == "7.9.3.1"`). Immutable export promotion uses POSIX
directory-descriptor safeguards, so this release supports that promotion on
macOS and Linux; an unsupported host refuses promotion rather than weakening
containment. A virtual environment keeps the OCCT dependency isolated from the
system Python:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/superWorldSavior/mcp-build123d.git
cd mcp-build123d
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements/runtime.txt -c requirements/constraints.txt
BUILD123D_PYTHON_BIN="$PWD/.venv/bin/python" deno task serve
```

The server binds to loopback and exposes Streamable HTTP at
`http://127.0.0.1:3014/mcp`. Check the process separately with:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3014/health
```

The same source checkout also runs as native stdio, with the identical tool,
resource, viewer, and error contracts:

```bash
BUILD123D_PYTHON_BIN="$PWD/.venv/bin/python" deno task serve:stdio
```

For example, a checkout-backed stdio entry is:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "build123d": {
      "command": "deno",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-A",
        "/absolute/path/to/mcp-build123d/server.ts",
        "--stdio"
      ],
      "env": {
        "BUILD123D_PYTHON_BIN": "/absolute/path/to/mcp-build123d/.venv/bin/python",
        "BUILD123D_EXPORT_DIR": "/absolute/path/to/mcp-build123d/cad-exports"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Run the published package

The published JSR package `0.7.1` can be started directly; Python and build123d
are still host dependencies:

```bash
BUILD123D_PYTHON_BIN="/absolute/path/to/qualified/python" \
  deno run -A jsr:@casys/mcp-build123d@0.7.1/server --port=3014
```

`-A` is intentional here: the public tools run arbitrary Python and write
exports. Use the source task or a container when you want to replace it with a
deployment-specific Deno permission set.

Point a Streamable HTTP-capable MCP client at the endpoint. The exact config
file location depends on the host; the connection entry is typically:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "build123d": {
      "type": "streamable-http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:3014/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

HTTP binds to `127.0.0.1` by default; `--hostname=0.0.0.0` is an explicit
network exposure. The `0.7.1` checkout supports native stdio and the
digest-bound resource contract described below.

### Run the published provider image

The dedicated image includes the qualified Python/CAD pair and Deno runtime. Set
`MCP_BUILD123D_IMAGE_DIGEST` to the exact `sha256:` digest in the GitHub Release
notes for the version you select. Do not substitute the historical broader
`engineering-toolchain` image, which is a different server release.

```bash
mkdir -p "$PWD/cad-exports"
: "${MCP_BUILD123D_IMAGE_DIGEST:?Set this to the exact sha256 digest in the GitHub Release notes}"
docker run --rm \
  --publish 127.0.0.1:3014:3014 \
  --volume "$PWD/cad-exports:/exports" \
  "ghcr.io/casys-ai/mcp-build123d@${MCP_BUILD123D_IMAGE_DIGEST}"
```

### Build a checkout locally

For a dedicated local image built from this checkout, use the committed
[`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile). It applies the same exact constraints and Deno base
image as CI and the published image:

```bash
docker build -t mcp-build123d:local .
mkdir -p cad-exports
docker run --rm \
  --publish 127.0.0.1:3014:3014 \
  --volume "$PWD/cad-exports:/exports" \
  mcp-build123d:local
```

The container is packaging, not a sandbox: the submitted Python still has the
container user's authority and can access anything mounted into it.

### Use with Casys

[Casys Digital Thread](https://github.com/superWorldSavior/casys-digital-thread)
ships a desktop chat that prepares this provider itself: no manual Docker or
image management. The proved flow (macOS, desktop `0.4.0`) opens a chat with
Muse as the default agent, enables Build123d from the catalogue, produces a
first Box geometry, edits it, and reopens the saved work.

See the
[Build123d provider reference](https://github.com/superWorldSavior/casys-digital-thread/blob/main/docs/reference/providers/build123d/README.md)
for the provider contract and integration boundaries.

## Security and trust boundary

`build123d_execute` and `build123d_export` run **arbitrary Python** on the
machine hosting this server. That is the point (CAD-as-code), not an accident.
Consequences:

- Only expose this server to callers you trust with shell-equivalent access.
- `build123d_export`'s managed outputs are confined to `BUILD123D_EXPORT_DIR`:
  file names are reduced to a safe basename (directory components stripped,
  extension imposed by the format). Those mutable delivery paths are verified,
  then copied into the server process's immutable resource memory; they are
  never a `resources/read` surface. The submitted Python is not confined by that
  output-path rule and can do anything Python can.
- Promotion reads delivery bytes through a short-lived isolated reader with a
  fixed five-second deadline. A special file or post-check staging swap fails
  closed; it cannot indefinitely block artifact issuance.
- Inputs, bridge stdout/stderr, each promoted export, and retained
  current-process artifacts have fixed server-side byte budgets. Exceeding one
  returns a stable non-retryable resource-limit recovery rather than retaining
  unbounded bytes. The bridge kills its POSIX process group on timeout or output
  overflow; this covers normal descendants, not a hostile process that escapes
  the group or a security sandbox.
- Loopback binding, safe export names, content-addressed resources, and timeouts
  are useful controls; none of them isolates the Python process. Put untrusted
  code behind a real sandbox with no secrets, network, or sensitive mounts.
- HTTP starts with wildcard CORS and no authentication. CORS is not an
  access-control mechanism. Keep HTTP on loopback, or place an authenticated
  reverse proxy or equivalent authenticated deployment boundary in front of the
  server before any non-loopback exposure.
- Submitted Python is not sandboxed. It has host or container user authority,
  including filesystem, process, and network access.

Report vulnerabilities privately as described in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

The server itself needs no account or API key. A submitted Python script still
inherits the host or container's filesystem, process, and network access.

### Evidence versus canonical product geometry

This standalone server returns real OCCT measurements and exact export-byte
digests. That proves what this invocation computed and wrote; it does not prove
that the script was reviewed, admitted, requirement-compliant, or canonical for
a product Digital Thread.

In `casys-digital-thread`, the canonical STEP route is the governed technical
source capture and compilation review followed by `compile.seal-admission@3`,
`project_admitted_geometry_export`, and `design.write-geometry@1`. The separate
`design.execute-build123d@1` isolated execution and
`design.seal-isolated-geometry@1` publication path is documentary, not the
canonical STEP authority. Keep those product-level authorities distinct from a
direct call to this standalone server.

## Tools and viewers

The server registers three MCP App resources:

| Resource                             | Tool results                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ui://mcp-build123d/results-viewer`  | `build123d_execute`, `build123d_export`, recorded Digital Thread geometry, and Project geometry reviews |
| `ui://mcp-build123d/assembly-viewer` | `build123d_observe_assembly_integrity`                                                                  |
| `ui://mcp-build123d/drawing-viewer`  | `build123d_project_2d`                                                                                  |

The geometry viewer presents the compact datasheet already used for direct and
recorded results. Its Three.js scene supports orbit, pan, zoom, fit, reset,
wireframe, visual section cuts, and an approximate two-point measurement on the
displayed GLB mesh. The approximate measurement is an inspection aid; exact
metrics remain the values calculated from the BREP by OCCT.

The assembly viewer presents the fixed STEP observation: import and topology
facts, direct occurrences, placements, and pair distances, contacts, and
intersection volumes. The drawing viewer switches among the fixed top, front,
right, and isometric SVG projections and, when requested and available, the
fixed mid-envelope YZ section.

All three viewers use the shared MCP View presentation and the exact
`Powered by Casys.ai` footer from the ERPNext beta visual language. Compatible
Compose hosts can still mount the geometry viewer's smaller status, readings,
canvas, and artifact components. Text responses remain available to every MCP
client.

The 2D output is for visual inspection. It has no dimensions, tolerances,
annotations, title block, or manufacturing approval, so it is not a
manufacturing drawing. Individual 3D component selection and injection into the
model context are also future work; current GLB results do not provide the
stable occurrence identities required for that interaction.

See the [viewer inventory](docs/viewer-inventory.md) for the exact surfaces,
their ERPNext beta design reference, and the role of the local examples. The
[MCP App documentation](docs/mcp-app.md) covers contracts, resource transport,
component composition, local builds, and screenshot capture.

### Script and geometry contract

The server does not maintain a second recipe language or a feature allowlist.
The selected Python environment determines which build123d APIs are available.
The stable server convention is smaller: the script must leave its final `Part`,
`Solid`, `Compound`, or `BuildPart` builder in a top-level variable named
`result`.

Build123d's default length convention is millimetres, which is why the public
metric fields are explicitly named `*_mm`, `*_mm2`, and `*_mm3`. A compound is
measured as one aggregate result, with total topology and one BREP centroid. The
server does not currently return an inertia tensor, per-solid mass properties,
material identity, tolerances, or manufacturing feasibility.

### `build123d_execute`

Runs a build123d script, returns exact metrics. The script must assign its final
shape to a variable named **`result`** (a Part, Solid, Compound, or a BuildPart
builder):

```python
from build123d import *

length, width, thickness = 60.0, 40.0, 5.0   # from a SysML PartUsage

with BuildPart() as bracket:
    Box(length, width, thickness)
    with Locations((15, 12, 0), (15, -12, 0)):
        Hole(3)

result = bracket
```

Structured response:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "1.0",
  "kind": "execution",
  "metrics": {
    "volume_mm3": 11717.2567,
    "area_mm2": 5875.3982,
    "center_of_mass_mm": [-0.362, 0, 0],
    "bounding_box_mm": {
      "min": [-30, -20, -2.5],
      "max": [30, 20, 2.5],
      "size": [60, 40, 5]
    },
    "solids": 1,
    "faces": 8,
    "edges": 18,
    "density_kg_m3": 2700,
    "mass_kg": 0.0316366
  },
  "files": []
}
```

Values are rounded from build123d 0.11.1 / OCCT for this example; the installed
Python environment is part of reproducibility.

**Mass requires an explicit `density_kg_m3`** (2700 for aluminium 6061, 7850 for
steel…). Without it, `mass_kg` is absent — it is never guessed from a material
name. One density applies uniformly to the complete result; heterogeneous
assemblies need to be evaluated per material outside this contract.

### `build123d_export`

Every entry in `files[]` contains `format` and an `artifact` object with a
content-addressed `uri`, MIME type, byte size, and SHA-256. The tool writes into
private managed delivery staging, verifies the bridge-reported bytes, then
issues a process-local immutable resource copy. Downstream tools should use
`resources/read` on that exact URI and recompute the digest on their own copy
when retaining evidence.

Same execution, plus files. `formats`: `step` (exact BREP), `stl` (mesh), `gltf`
(binary `.glb`). `BUILD123D_EXPORT_DIR` is mutable staging (default
`./cad-exports`); it is not an agent-readable interface. Each call uses and
removes its own staging directory when it finishes. The response returns only
immutable artifact references alongside the same metrics.

Example tool input using the script above:

```json
{
  "script": "from build123d import *\nwith BuildPart() as bracket:\n    Box(60, 40, 5)\nresult = bracket\n",
  "formats": ["step", "stl", "gltf"],
  "name": "bracket-r1",
  "density_kg_m3": 2700,
  "timeout_ms": 60000
}
```

### `build123d_observe_assembly_integrity`

Observes one exact STEP Part 21 artifact without executing caller code. Supply
exactly one of two closed forms — never both, neither, or extra fields.

Inline digest-bound bytes, for STEP evidence this process does not already own:

```json
{
  "step": {
    "mimeType": "model/step",
    "sha256": "lowercase-sha256-of-the-decoded-bytes",
    "bytes": 32536,
    "blob": "canonical-padded-base64-of-those-exact-bytes"
  }
}
```

`bytes` must be positive and at most 128 MiB.

A current-process owned STEP resource, using the issued artifact identity fields
`uri`, `mimeType`, `sha256`, and `bytes` (not `schemaVersion` or `format`):

```json
{
  "stepResource": {
    "uri": "casys://build123d/artifacts/<lowercase-sha256>.step",
    "mimeType": "model/step",
    "sha256": "<lowercase-sha256>",
    "bytes": 32536
  }
}
```

The URI digest must match `sha256` and the registered object. Only an immutable
`model/step` artifact issued by this process's artifact store is accepted;
generic MCP resources, host paths, and leftover disk objects are not. After
restart the store is empty, so a previous URI is unknown even if a forged file
still exists. Owned artifacts stay at the store's 32 MiB per-object bound (the
inline form remains 128 MiB). The bridge rehashes verified bytes and checks the
Part 21 envelope before staging them privately for a fixed OCCT/XCAF harness.
There are no caller-selected paths, Python, tolerances, transforms or timeouts.

The versioned `build123d-assembly-integrity-observation/1.0` result carries the
exact input identity, fixed method, and a closed producer block:

```json
{
  "producer": {
    "service": "mcp-build123d",
    "packageVersion": "0.7.1",
    "tool": "build123d_observe_assembly_integrity",
    "engine": { "name": "cadquery-ocp", "version": "7.9.3.1" }
  }
}
```

Every fact is either `observed`, `unresolved`, or `unavailable`. Direct
occurrences are printable-ASCII labels sorted bytewise (maximum 32). An observed
placement is a row-major rigid 4×4 XCAF `Location` matrix in the STEP file's
observed millimetres; it is not an expected or requested pose. The tool emits
every canonical direct-label pair (maximum 496) with the fixed `1e-6 mm`
tolerance, minimum distance, intersection volume, and `contact` fact. These are
kernel facts, not a pass/fail decision. The contract has no project,
requirement, fitness, safety, motion, strength, or verdict fields.

The `producer.engine` block identifies the installed `cadquery-ocp` binding
whose `OCP.__version__` is read by the fixed harness. It does not claim a
Standard OCCT API build version, an image digest, or a sandbox/network policy
attestation; the fixed method still describes the OCCT/XCAF observation.

### `build123d_project_2d`

Projects one exact STEP Part 21 artifact into a fixed set of SVG inspection
views without executing caller code. Supply exactly one of the same closed
`step` or current-process `stepResource` forms documented for
`build123d_observe_assembly_integrity`. The only additional input is the
optional fixed-section switch:

```json
{
  "stepResource": {
    "uri": "casys://build123d/artifacts/<lowercase-sha256>.step",
    "mimeType": "model/step",
    "sha256": "<lowercase-sha256>",
    "bytes": 32536
  },
  "includeSection": true
}
```

The fixed method returns top, front, right, and isometric projections. With
`includeSection: true`, it also attempts a YZ section at the source envelope's
midpoint on X; an empty section is omitted. The result binds the exact STEP
identity, qualified build123d/OCP engine, fixed method, source envelope, and
digest-checked SVG bytes for every view.

The tool accepts no caller path, Python, camera, orientation, projection style,
section plane, tolerance, or runtime choice. Its SVGs are visual inspection
projections. They do not contain dimensions, tolerances, annotations, a title
block, or a manufacturing verdict, and must not be treated as manufacturing
drawings.

### Content and digest semantics

- Each call runs the script once. `build123d_export` derives all requested
  formats and the reported metrics from that one in-memory result.
- After that successful bridge result, the current server process holds a
  direct-execution receipt alongside an immutable in-memory artifact copy. The
  receipt binds source, request, metrics and output-set digests with literal
  `not-admitted` status; it never stores submitted source text or crosses
  `structuredContent`. Resources are deliberately not restored after restart:
  any object or receipt prewritten on disk is ignored. This is not a Digital
  Thread operation or admission ledger, and it does not make an artifact
  canonical product geometry.
- An export delivery path is mutable and private. Each call stages under a
  separate directory, then removes that directory on completion; reusing a
  `name` in another call does not share a delivery path. The returned
  `artifact.uri` is digest-bound and names the immutable current-process copy.
  `resources/read` rehashes that copy before it returns any bytes. Promotion
  uses a fixed five-second isolated read deadline, so a special file or staging
  swap fails closed instead of stalling the artifact queue. After a server
  restart, run a new export before reading an artifact URI again.
- `build123d_export` passes the UTC sentinel `1970-01-01T00:00:00Z` to
  build123d's native STEP `timestamp` parameter. That sentinel is a
  reproducibility marker, not the execution or export time. This provider starts
  only with the qualified `build123d==0.11.1` and
  `cadquery-ocp-novtk==7.9.3.1.1` pair. Its observed `OCP.__version__` is
  `7.9.3.1`; other provider releases may change bytes.
- Digest equality proves byte equality, not geometric equivalence. Export bytes
  can change across build123d, OCCT, or exporter versions even when a shape is
  visually equivalent.
- STEP, STL, and GLB all use the same general artifact-resource contract.
  Resource metadata contains the MIME type, size, SHA-256, format, and immutable
  flag. No caller-controlled filesystem path is accepted by the resource reader.

The bridge is a subprocess speaking JSON — the same architectural choice as
`@casys/constraint-solver`'s z3 backend: identical behaviour under Deno and
Node, no WASM, and the heavyweight dependency (Python + OCCT) stays on the
selected host or in its container.

## Composing the chain

In a standalone workflow, `build123d_execute`'s mass feeds
`@casys/constraint-solver` (via `@casys/mcp-syson`'s
`syson_constraint_evaluate`) to check a computed mass against a SysML mass
budget — with units. A STEP artifact read from `build123d_export` is the entry
point for FEA meshing. Each link is a separate MCP server; the agent composes
them.

## Development

```bash
deno task test     # full CAD integration cases need Python 3.10+ with build123d
deno check mod.ts server.ts
```
